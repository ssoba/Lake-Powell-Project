### Summary 
Phytoplankton increased in biovolume, with mean total biovolume increasing by 8.50 10<sup>8</sup> Œºm<sup>3</sup>/L.  Biovolume increased in every month for almost every type of phytoplankton (Fig. 5). The increases in biovolume were especially notable during the early spring and late winter. June had the greatest increase in total biovolume, with an increase of 3.10 ùóë 10<sup>9</sup> Œºm<sup>3</sup>/L in phytoplankton biovolume from 1994 to 2014 (Fig. 5).

### Order-Specific Changes 
**Cyanobacteria** increased in July, September, and December. These increases in Cyanobacteria suggest that they were experiencing increased blooms in the summer and winter during times they may not have been present before. From 1993 to 2014, Cyanobacteria populations increased by 1.68 ùóë 108 Œºm3/L in July. From 1993 to 2014, December biovolume of Cyanobacteria increased from 0  Œºm<sup>3</sup>/ to 1.61 ùóë 10<sup>7</sup> Œºm<sup>3</sup>/L (Fig. 5).** Diatoms** increased in early summer, with the greatest increases in June (change in Diatom volume from 1994 to 2014 = 3.02 ùóë 10<sup>9</sup> Œºm<sup>3</sup>L; Fig 5). **Chlorophyta** increased throughout the year, especially during February, the summer months, and November. Euglenophyta decreased during July but increased otherwise. **Cryptophyta** increased in the late winter and early spring. The significant increase (p ‚â§ 0.05) during January, February, and December suggest that Cryptophyta increased their temporal range. **Chrysophyta** and **Phyrrophyta** also experienced an increase in their temporal range, with significant (p ‚â§ 0.05) increases in February and September for Chrysophyta and increases in February, August, and September for Phyrrophyta. The total phytoplankton biovolume increased significantly (p ‚â§ 0.05) during almost all months of the year (Fig. 6).
