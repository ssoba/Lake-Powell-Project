Our temperature analyses of Lake Powell show the layers of the reservoir (surface, metalimnion, and hypolimnion) are changing independently. Between 1990 and 2014, significant warming in the surface occurred in December and July, while the rest of the months portray either more gradual warming or stable temperature trends (Fig. 2). The lack of significant surface warming between February and April refutes hypothesized trends of how global climate change and overall increasing temperatures would impact water bodies during the spring. The metalimnion showed trends of slight cooling in almost all months over the 25 year study period, with only one month (November) possessing significant cooling trends (Fig. 3). Hypolimnion temperatures warmed slightly in every month between 1990 and 2014, but with not months of significant warming (Fig. 4). The lack of a significant temperature change in the hypolimnion is expected as Lake Powell rarely mixes, preventing warmer surface waters from homogenizing with cold deeper waters. While there were minimal changes in the temperatures of Lake Powellâ€™s different layers, the area of the epilimnion is significantly increasing in February and significantly increasing between May and August (Table 1). 

Phytoplankton biovolume in Lake Powell is increasing throughout the year, with significant increases occurring during the early spring and summer (Fig. 6). Phytoplankton communities bloom earlier in the spring and persist until later, identifying an expanded temporal niche. This is likely due to the increasing prevalence of favorable environmental conditions. Increasing phytoplankton biovolume likely decreases water clarity, posing a serious problem for Lake Powell. Lower water clarity poses detriments to the economic value and appeal of the lake, decreasing the attractiveness of the water body for recreation (Douglas & Harpman, 2004). However, as alluded to earlier, the deepening of the epilimnion would suggest that the water clarity is increasing. Additional studies should determine Lake Powell water clarity through Secchi disk testing. Increasing biovolume and temporal persistence of primary producers in Lake Powell should be able to support a larger zooplankton population, preventing a temporal mismatch between the primary producers and primary consumers. Within this, biovolume of all phytoplankton divisions measured are communities of phytoplankton are increasing overall with the exception of Euglenophyta, but the magnitude and significance of changes are seasonal-dependent (Fig. 6). 

Total zooplankton biomass did not vary over the course of the study period, besides from in June (Fig. 8). As a result, it was necessary to determine how the biomass of each of the three major zooplankton divisions changes over time, as they all exhibited unique trends. Biomass of the temperature-cued Rotifera increased in the winter months of December and January, following significantly increasing temperatures in the epilimnion in the same time frame (Fig. 8). This indicates that the slightly warmer temperatures resulted in advanced zooplankton blooms in the spring, following results from (Dupuis & Hann,  2009). Light-cued zooplankton (Copepoda and cladocera) exhibited opposite trends - Copepoda biomass decreased between February and April, while cladoceran populations increased during the same time frame (Fig. 8). Downward trending Copepoda biomass early in the spring indicates that populations are stressed by external factors during this time frame. Such stresses could include decreasing food availability or unfit environmental conditions.
